Approach Taken

Two-model CRUD application for creating and sharing recipes. Users can create an account, login, and create recipe posts to share. The recipes page primarily utilizes flexbox and AngularJS's filtering capabilities.

Unsolved Problems

Although update and delete for users and recipes worked on the backend via postman testing, we were unable to grab the user ID or recipe ID to update and delete users and recipes on the front end.


Notes/Planned Features

Getting our update and delete routes working on the front end
Adding user reviews on recipes
Adding ratings for recipes posted
Change account settings to allow photos and location for the user
Various UI improvements
